# Skin_Cancer_Classification

## AIM of the Project:
This project focuses on skin cancer detection using a convolutional neural network (CNN) on a dataset comprising benign and malignant skin images. The objective is to build a model that accurately classifies skin lesions, aiding in early detection and diagnosis.


## Data Preprocessing: 
Images are resized, converted to NumPy arrays, and normalized for further analysis.

## Models Used:
Convolutional Neural Network (CNN): A simple CNN is constructed using TensorFlow, consisting of convolutional layers, max-pooling, and dense layers with dropout for classification.

## Training and Evaluation: 
The model is trained on the prepared dataset, utilizing early stopping to prevent overfitting. The accuracy is evaluated on the test set using the scikit-learn accuracy_score metric.

## Daily Scenario Application:
This project's application extends to real-world scenarios where an automated tool for skin cancer detection can assist dermatologists and individuals. By analyzing skin images, the model aids in identifying potential malignancies promptly, facilitating timely medical intervention and enhancing diagnostic efficiency.

## Conclusion:
The project demonstrates the practical implementation of deep learning in healthcare, specifically for skin cancer detection. The CNN model achieves accuracy in distinguishing between benign and malignant lesions. Such AI-driven tools can serve as valuable support in healthcare systems, contributing to early diagnosis and improved patient outcomes.
